**Awareness is the key** - being aware of your thoughts and emotions, being aware of your energy levels, how you feel in your body, all of this will bring a deeper awareness of your cravings and your choices.

This relates to what you eat and drink, but also what you take in and digest at other levels - **what you feed your mind effects your emotions** (directly through the nervous system and endocrine system). And in a more abstract way, what you feed your soul effects how you feel in your own skin (think how different you feel walking in nature to sitting at your computer, or scrolling on your phone).

**Health is a relationship with yourself** - and like all healthy relationships it requires time, and the willingness to listen, even when it's uncomfortable. Get to know yourself, there's a lot more going on than meets the eye!

**The breath will carry you through** - when in doubt, breathe. When you're struggling, breathe. When you're craving to eat something you know you want to let go of, breathe. When you're feeling difficult emotions, breathe. When your thoughts are driving you crazy, breathe. When you don't think you have time to do this, breathe. **The breath is your greatest ally in life**, experience its power for yourself.

**Choose what works for you**. It's as simple and as challenging as that.

The first step is awareness - become aware of what works for you and what doesn't. And then **practice choosing what works**. It is a practice, not a destination.

**Progress not perfection** - we've been told 'practice makes perfect', but does it? In my experience life is about progress not perfection. When I'm engaged in the enquiry of how I can progress, I remain open and curious. When I'm attached to finding perfection I become judgemental and controlling.

**Show up and keep it in the day** - stay present as much as you can today, and you'll learn what there is for you to learn today. **The breath is the fastest way to step into the present**.

When you find yourself ruminating on the past or projecting into the future, breathe and come into the here and now... that is where the miracle is happening.
