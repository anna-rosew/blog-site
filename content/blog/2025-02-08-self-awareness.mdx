When you turn towards yourself with a willingness to listen, you may hear the things that you have been consciously or unconsciously avoiding. This can be uncomfortable!

Keep your conscious practices alive throughout the day - they will hold you when you feel wobbly. They offer an alternative choice when you have the urge to distract yourself rather than allow what is moving to move.

## Introduction

By distraction, I mean things like snacking, procrastination, social media, TV, internet surfing, shopping, busyness, or whatever else you turn to.

Below are **7 helpful practices** for staying present to yourself and allowing what is moving to move. When you have that urge to reach for distractions, **remember - you have a choice.**

Your **response-ability** is to choose how to respond. This is an ability that you master through practice. **Progress, not perfection!**

## 7 Practices for Staying Present

### Left Nostril Breathing

As simple as it sounds - close off your right nostril with your thumb (fingers pointing to the sky) and breathe long and deep. Begin to extend the exhale.

If you need a mantra to anchor the mind, try "So Hum" which translates as "inhale, exhale." This mantra has the power to open you to your inner guide - your intuitive wisdom.

### Walking in Nature {#walking-in-nature}

You know it works!

### Grounding

- Walk barefoot on the grass, staying present to your connection with the Earth
- If that is not possible, sit with eyes closed and consciously connect with the Earth beneath you
- Feel yourself anchored into the Earth's core - this will help you feel held and centered
- In both cases, exhale your discomfort down into the Earth and inhale fresh Spring energy up from the Earth

### Breath of Fire

One of the fastest ways to shift your mood and bring you back to the present moment. It also has many great health benefits - very cleansing!

Here is a 5-minute video you can use.

### Stroking Each Arm

- Sit up and ground through your sit bones
- Close your eyes and breathe deeply
- Slowly stroke down your left arm, then your right
- Go back and forth between the two until you feel an inner shift

If you need a mantra, try: "This too shall pass."

### Shake it Out

It only takes a few minutes to move that gorgeous body of yours and allow knots and tension to dissolve. Put on a funky track if you need to get in the mood!

### Journaling

Write it down so it is on the paper and not in your head. Keep writing until you feel that inner shift.
