Starting your day mindfully doesn't require hours of meditation or complex rituals. This simple 5-minute routine can help you set a positive tone for the entire day ahead.

1. Take three deep breaths as soon as you wake up
2. Set an intention for your day while still in bed
3. Stretch your body gently for 2 minutes
4. Express gratitude for one thing in your life
5. Visualize your day going smoothly

Remember, consistency matters more than perfection. Try this routine for a week and notice how it affects your daily mindset and energy levels.
